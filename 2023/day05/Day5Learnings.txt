1) You have to do the same using Shell Script i.e using either Loops or command with start day and end day variables using arguments -
So Write a bash script createDirectories.sh that when the script is executed with three given arguments (one is directory name and second is start number of directories and third is the end number of directories ) it creates specified number of directories with a dynamic directory name.



#! /bin/bash

begin=${2}
end=${3}
for (( i = begin; i <= end; i++ )); do
        mkdir $1$i
done

2) Create a Script to backup all your work done till now.
