1) You have to do the same using Shell Script i.e using either Loops or command with start day and end day variables using arguments -
So Write a bash script createDirectories.sh that when the script is executed with three given arguments (one is directory name and second is start number of directories and third is the end number of directories ) it creates specified number of directories with a dynamic directory name.



#! /bin/bash

begin=${2}
end=${3}
for (( i = begin; i <= end; i++ )); do
        mkdir $1$i
done

2) Create a Script to backup all your work done till now.

3) Read About Cron and Crontab, to automate the backup Script

I have modified crontab -e for the backup scrfipt to run at 4:17 UTC time EVERYDAY

17 4 * * * bash /home/ubuntu/bash_course/backup-script.sh


4) Read about User Management and Let me know on Linkedin if you're ready for Day 6.

I am ready for Day 6

5) Create 2 users and just display their Usernames

sudo useradd username1 (sudo only if needed for the user you are logged in as)
sudo password username1
sudo su username1
whoami

sudo useradd username2
sudo password username2
sudo su username2
whoami
